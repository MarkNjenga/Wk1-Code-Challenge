##  Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
## JavaScript
1. The speedDetector() function contains the logic for calculating the demerit points of a car based on the speed input.It contains:
- A constant maximum speed
- A prompt() function which is used to ask the user to input the car's speed, and the input is stored in the speedInput variable.
- The Number() function is used to convert the user's input stored in speedInput to a numerical value.
- The first if statement checks if the car speed is less than or equal to the maximum speed and if the condition is me, the code inside the code block is executed. If otherwise, the code inside else is executed.
- The second if else statement checks if the demerit points are greator than the maximum and if the conditions are met, the code  inside its code block is executed.
